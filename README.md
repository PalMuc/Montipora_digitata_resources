# Transcriptomic Resilience of a Coral Holobiont to Low pH

Raúl A. González-Pech, Sergio Vargas, Warren R. Francis & Gert Wörheide

This repository is the companion site for González-Pech et al. submitted. and contains the transcriptome of *Montipora digitata*, the transcriptome annotations and the count matrix used in the manuscripts to assess the effect of ocean acidification on gene expression in this coral system.

The repository is organized in an easy-to-follow manner. The count matrices used in the analyses of gene expression can be found in the folder **Counts**, the annotated transcriptome for the coral and its symbionts can be found the folder **Annotated_transcriptome** and the script used to analyze the data in R with DESeq2 can be found in the folder **Scripts**. Please note that this repository will be constantly update for a while and that, probably, some files are going to change with time. Because of this, we strongly encourage you to **clone or fork** the repository and to avoid downloading it. This way you can always have an updated version of the repository. Once the contents of this repository are stable, we will produce a release of the repository and mint a DOI for it.

If you have comments or concerns about the data or scripts, please use the *Issues* tab provided by Github. We are not going to answer to comments or concerns about the repository unless they are documented in as an *Issues*. This is so to increase the transparency of the repository and of changes done in response to individual requests. Please remember that, although we are happy to fix/correct errors raised through the *Issues* tab of the repo, this may take a while. We will try our best to keep the repo in a nice state and correct errors as soon as possible.
